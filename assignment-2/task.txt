Implement the vector clock algorithm to enable totally ordered events in the distributed system. 
Similar to the previous assignment, we use multiple processes to emulate multiple nodes. 

Assume that all nodes are initiated to the same vector clock. After completing a local operation, 
each process sends its updated vector clock to all other processes. 

Follow the steps on slide 34 in Lecture 6 to implement the vector clock algorithm.
