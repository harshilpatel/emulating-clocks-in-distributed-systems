Implement a locking scheme to protect a share file in your distributed system. While we use processes on a single machine to emulate the distributed system and there are shared-memory synchronization primitives available, you are required to implement one of the following distributed locking schemes: centralized, decentralized, distributed locking or the token ring algorithm. When a process acquires the lock, it simply opens the file, increments a counter in the file, and closes the file. Assume that all processes keep requesting the lock until successfully acquiring the lock for a predefined number of times.
